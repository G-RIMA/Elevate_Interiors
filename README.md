# Elevate_Interiors

This is an ecommerce website I build to learn how to create applications using React

## React
React is a Javascript Library to build interactive user interfaces

I can use React to:
 + Create dynamic storage
 + Reusable UI components
 + virtual DOM
 + jsx


## What we need:
The steps:
+ create an environment for rect by downloading node.js
+ a text editor: for this we used VS CODE


## Create the react app
+ Open the terminal then type:
  ```
  npm install create-react-app -g
  ```
+ create react application
  ``` 
  create-react-app (app name) elevate
  ```
